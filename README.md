# WELLness 🧠 – ML Powered Sentiment Analysis Web App

WELLness is an intelligent and user-friendly web application that leverages MACHINE LEARNING to analyze the sentiment behind your thoughts and expressions. With a simple and elegant interface, this application enables users to enter a message or feeling and receive instant feedback about the emotional tone - whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.

## 🌟 Features

- 🧠 Built using a trained ML model (joblib-based)
- 💻 Flask-based backend
- 🎨 Stylish, responsive frontend UI with dark theme and polished CSS
- 📝 Real-time sentiment prediction from text
- 📚 “About” and “Instructions” sections for users
- 🌐 Fully deployable as a single-page web application
